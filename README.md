The bot for a Winter-Spring 2022 marketing action of a large Russian food retailer (name of retailer is deformed to reduce the probability of googling of the bot).
The bot registers accounts, manages them, plays "the game" and stores coupons. All requests to maagneet api are signed using combination of few HmacSHA512 with a key extracted from the original apk.
The project also includes modified copy of official Java sms-activate API (to use with other sms activation services): it was not forked due to legal problems.
